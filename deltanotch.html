							<h2>Abstract</h2>
							<p style="text-indent: 40px;">This project investigates the role of Delta-Notch signaling in neural cell differentiation. This signaling mechanism allows for neighboring cells to interact to regulate their protein concentration, resulting in a diverse pattern of functionally different cells in the brain. The mechanism involves a ligand-receptor binding system with Delta as a transmembrane ligand and Notch as a receptor. Upon binding, the receptor is activated, releasing Notch intracellular domain (NICD) into the cell cytoplasm. NICD increases Notch transcription and inhibits Delta expression, leading to a regulation in Delta-Notch binding rate in neighboring cells. This lateral inhibition mechanism induces divergent cell fates, with cells expressing high Delta levels becoming neurons and those with high Notch levels becoming glial cells. A Python-based simulation model using differential equations and agent-based dynamical network is developed to visualize and analyze the cell differentiation process in the brain over time. </p>
							<h2>Introduction</h2>
							<p style="text-indent: 40px;">During embryonic development, neural precursors in the brain differentiate into functionally diverse neurons and glial cells. This differentiation is made possible by a mechanism of signaling between neighboring embryonic stem cells in the brain, called Delta-Notch signaling. This signaling mechanism allows cells to receive input from their neighbors and regulate their protein concentration, similar to how leaky and integrating neurons compute their membrane potentials. The change in protein concentration within a cell subsequently affects the protein level of neighboring cells. As a result, this lateral inhibition mechanism acts to differentiate the concentration of Delta ligands and Notch receptors within the system, leading to a diverse pattern of functionally different cells in the brain. In this project, I aim to construct a network of embryonic stem cells in the brain and model the Delta-Notch signaling system to investigate its role in cell differentiation.</p>
							<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Delta-Notch signaling utilizes a ligand-receptor binding mechanism to induce divergent cell fates among neighboring cells. Delta is a transmembrane ligand while Notch is a transmembrane receptor. Upon binding of a neighboring Delta ligand to a cellâ€™s Notch receptor, the receptor is activated, which results in the release of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) into the cell cytoplasm. NICD acts to upregulate the transcription of Notch receptors while inhibiting the expression of Delta ligands within the cell. Consequently, this inhibition of Delta ligand expression leads to the reduction of Delta-Notch binding and NICD release in neighboring cells. In summary, when a cell's Notch copy number increases, the Notch transcription rates of adjacent cells are inhibited, while the Delta transcription is encouraged. Eventually, the cells expressing high Notch level become glial cells, while those with high Delta level become neurons. The figure below summarizes this modulatory mechanism.</p>

							</div>
							<p style="text-indent: 40px;">In this project, I developed a Python-based dynamical network of cell differentiation with the Delta-Notch signaling model. To achieve this, I generated an agent-based network model that imitates the grid of cells. The model incorporates a system that uses differential equations and pre-established functions to compute the copy number of Delta and Notch in each cell, considering factors such as protein production rate, ligand-receptor binding rate, and degradation rate. The simulation continually updates the protein level of each cell agent by utilizing information from neighboring cells as well as cell-intrinsic mechanisms. Using this model, I was able to visualize the process of cell differentiation in the brain and analyze its rate over time.</p>

								<p>Figure 3: Visualization of the Cell Differentiation Process</p>
							</div>
							<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Figure 3 shows the results of the dynamical network simulation of the cell differentiation process. The subplots illustrate the Notch level of every cell after 1,000, 20,000, and 30,000 time steps. The color red denotes high Notch levels, which correspond to low Delta levels, while the color blue denotes low Notch levels, which correspond to high Delta levels. The visualization clearly demonstrates that as the cells interact more over time, the differentiation of Delta and Notch concentration levels becomes more pronounced.</p>
							<p style="text-indent: 40px;">A notable observation from the cell grid visualization figure is that the cells situated on the outermost periphery of the network are more prone to expressing high Delta levels. This phenomenon may be linked to the fact that these cells have fewer neighbors, resulting in a reduced probability of Notch receptors binding with Delta ligands. Consequently, there is a decreased release of NICD, which typically downregulates Delta production. Thus, cells on the outer border area, where there are fewer neighbors, tend to exhibit high Delta levels.</p>
							<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Correspondingly, cells with a high number of contacting cells tend to exhibit high concentrations of Notch even in the early stages of the simulation. After only 1,000 time steps, these cells exhibit a deep red color, indicating high Notch levels. Interestingly, these cells tend to have a slender and elongated shape, giving them a greater contact area relative to their actual size. This increased surface area likely promotes more frequent trans-activation binding events with Delta ligands from neighboring cells, leading to a higher Notch concentration.</p>
							<p style="text-indent: 40px;">It is evident that after 30,000 time steps, the cells have taken on distinct cell fates. The cells are displaying either a vivid red or blue color, indicating a clear divergence from neighboring cells and a more bipolar concentration in terms of Notch and Delta levels. It is worth noting that prior mathematical modeling research on Delta-Notch signaling found a high-expressing Notch cells to high-expressing Delta cells ratio of 3 to 1. However, the present model displays the opposite result, with a high-expressing Notch cell typically surrounded by high-expressing Delta cells. Possible limitations of our model that could have contributed to this result are discussed in the "discussion" section.</p>

								<p>Figure 4: Density Plot of Protein Level Distribution</p>
							</div>
							<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Figure 4 shows density plots of protein level distribution across different time steps. The three plots represent the distribution of Notch, Delta, and the difference between Notch and Delta (Notch - Delta) levels across all cells at a specific time point. The color in the figure legend represents the corresponding time step. The dispersion of protein levels is seen to increase with time in all three plots. The plot depicting the difference in level between Notch and Delta concentrations took the longest time to disperse, and thus displays the analysis results at time step 11,000, 14,000, and 17,000, unlike the other two.</p>
