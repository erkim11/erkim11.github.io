							<h1>#4 Patient Genome Analysis</h1>
							<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.5em;">Comparative Analysis of SNP Genomic Data in Patients with<br>Anxiety Disorder and Major Depressive Disorder</p>
							<p style="text-align: center;">Click <a href="files/sds322e.pdf">here</a> to view the full report including the code</p>
							<p>This project was conducted as part of the [SDS 322E] Elements of Data Science course, taught by Professor Layla Guyot during the Spring 2023 semester at The University of Texas at Austin.</p>
							<h2>Introduction</h2>
							<p style="text-indent: 40px;">In this project, I will analyze two genomic meta datasets from two separate scientific papers. Both datasets were acquired from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) database.</p>
              						<p style="text-indent: 40px;">The data focuses on Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP), which is a type of genomic mutation where one nucleotide in the DNA differs from other individuals in the population. In the study, the authors obtained the information of genomic SNP via comparing genome sequencing data from patient group and control group.</p>
              						<p style="text-indent: 40px;">The potential trend I’m interested in investigating is how the patterns of SNP in the genome differs between those with anxiety disorder (AD) and major depressive disorder (MDD). Along with the differences, I expect some similarity between the two, due to the overlapping biological nature of the disorders. My research question for this project is: Are there any significant difference in SNP profiles between patients with AD or MDD, and can we identify any potential genetic markers associated with these disorders?</p>
							<h2>Results</h2>
							<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Throughout the project, I analyzed two genomic datasets obtained from studies on Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) in patients that have anxiety disorder (AD) and major depressive disorder (MDD). The research question I investigated was: Are there any significant difference in SNP profiles between patients with AD or MDD, and can we identify any potential genetic markers associated with these disorders?</p>
              						<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Firstly, it was observed from initial data analysis in the ‘II. Joining/Merging’ section that the two SNP datasets share a lot of common single nucleotide polymorphisms. In addition, there were more SNP that were characterized in MDD patients but not in AD, compared to vice versa.</p>

							</div>
							<p style="text-indent: 40px;">In the analysis of the allelic variations in section ‘V. Visualizing; b. Number of Allelic Variations by Disorder,’ both disorders had high instances of A > G and T > C mutations compared to any other allelic combinations. No significant differences were observed when comparing the prevalence of allelic variation between AD patients and MDD patients.</p>

							<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Finally, in the section ‘V. Visualizing; c. Cases of Allelic Variation by Chromosomal Location,’ comprehensive analysis on SNP profiles for each disorder was possible. Both disorders had common chromosomes with low SNP mutations, such as chromosome 6 and 19. Notably, chromosome 6 had low SNP cases in both disorders despite its relatively long length. On the other hand, chromosome 7 had significantly low SNP prevalence in MDD patients, but not as much in AD patients. This could be a potential genetic marker differentiating those with MDD from AD, but further analysis on the actual mutations within chromosome 7 is necessary to verify the indication of this result. Furthermore, analysis on AD patients showed a bigger difference in number of cases of SNP across chromosomes, but it is possible that this effect is due to differing sample size, as discovered in section ‘IV. Wrangling; a. Summary Statistics - Cases.’</p>
