							<p>This project was conducted as part of the [NEU 340] Neural Systems III: Quantitative Tools course, taught by Professor Roman Corfas during the Fall 2022 semester at The University of Texas at Austin.</p>
							<h2>Introduction</h2>
							<p style="text-indent: 40px;">This project examines neuronal activity in the cerebellum during a classical conditioning trial. The question I will be investigating is how the rates of learning an association (acquisition) and rates of extinguishing the association (extinction) differ in cerebellar cells. I will be using datasets generated from a computational simulation developed by the lab of Dr. Michael Mauk. I chose this topic because I am interested in learning how a computational simulation can model the activities of neurons. Moreover, Iâ€™m interested to see how different cerebellar neurons act while it undergoes learning.</p>
							<p style="text-indent: 40px;">The simulation models the behavior of different neurons in the cerebellum during an eyelid conditioning trial, which is one of the widely used classical conditioning methods. The data I gathered from the simulation are raster files of spike activities from 2 different type of neurons (Purkinje cell, Deep Nucleus cell) over time, as the assocation is learned and extinguished. Each trial that the neurons undergo is either strengthening the learned association or weakening it. In my experiment, the first 500 trials were designed to strengthen the association (acquisition) and the following 500 trials were designed to weaken the association (extinction). In summary, my dataset includes activity of 2 different types of cerebellar neurons over 1000 trials. Within each trial, spike activity of all neurons are recorded for a certain period of time whose units will be in milliseconds.</p>
							<h2>Discussion</h2>
							<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Overall, I learned that the patterns of acquisition and extinction vary greatly by ISI. Although rates of acquisition and extinction differed within a single ISI data, there was no significant pattern of difference when datasets from all ISI were used to conduct a paired t-test.</p>

								<p>Figure 3. Graph of Purkinje Cell Activity (Minimum Spike Number) Across Trials</p>
							</div>
							<p style="text-indent: 40px;">In Figure 3., there was a slight pattern where, as the interstimulus interval of the data increased, the number of trials to get to extinction decreased, which means extinction happened relatively faster. Except for ISI 250 ms, the number of trials to get to acquisition increased as ISI increased as well. However, this pattern was not directly represented in my acquisition/extinction rate analysis, since I conducted linear regression analysis that takes the y-axis (minimum spike num) into account as well as the x-axis (trial number).</p>

								<p>Figure 5. Acquisition and Extinction Rates in Trials with Different Interstimulus Intervals</p>
							</div>
							<p style="text-indent: 40px;">In Figure 5., the rates of acquisition and extinction tend to decrease as ISI increases, although the trial with ISI 250 ms did not fit this pattern.</p>
							<p style="text-indent: 40px;">A limitation of my analysis was that I had only 1 data file from each interstimulus intervals. Having higher number of datsets would have helped the statistical comparison. Paired t-test analysis could have yielded a more significant result if I had gathered multiple data from each ISI. Future studies could be done by gathering multiple datasets and conducting further statistical analysis using ANOVA test or paired t-test.</p>
